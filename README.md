## Project Overview
Stocka is an inventory digital solution that will take account of trader's sales and stocks, calculates their profits or losses over a specific period of time and offer 
suggestions to build profits.<br/>
Many traders in the Western Africa have been accustomed to writing daily sales and stocks on paper which are invaluable and volatile. As we are all human and prone to errors, they are equally bound to make mistakes in credit and debit calculations.<br/>
Some of the wow features of Stocka will include a long term graphical analysis to predict future gains, goods scanner for ease at point of purchase, and daily profit and loss results.
